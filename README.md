# Kaggle House Prices Prediction Kernel

The [notebook](kernel.ipynb) in this repository corresponds to my Kaggle kernel [Lasso and XGBoost - Top 15%](https://www.kaggle.com/jonhar/lasso-and-xgboost-top-15) for the Kaggle challenge [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/). In contrast to the Kaggle Kernel, hyper-parameter tuning for XGBoost is done automatically in the notebook available here, while I had manually set the hyper-parameters in the Kaggle kernel then. There are some small differences in numbers between the two notebooks. However, the idea is the same.
